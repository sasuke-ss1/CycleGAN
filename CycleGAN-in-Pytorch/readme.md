# CycleGAN with Skip Connection (PyTorch)

This is my own implementation of CycleGAN using PyTorch, introduced in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf).
The main task was to carry out image-to-image translation from Horse to Zebra.

## Repository 

This repository contains:
* **CycleGAN.py** : Complete code for ALL steps of CycleGAN Implementation
* **visualize_test_images.py** : Code for genearating & visualizing new images using the test set, using the saved pre-trained parameters '~.pt' files 
					  
## Results

## Datasets

Datasets necessary for CycleGAN projects can be downloaded from [this link](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~taesung_park/CycleGAN/datasets/).

## List of Hyperparameters used:

* Batch Size = **1**
* Generated Image Size = **128 x 128**  
* Number of Filters in Discriminator's first hidden layer = **64**
* Number of Filters in Generator's first hidden layer = **64**
* Initial Learning Rate = **0.0002**
* Number of Epochs = **55**
